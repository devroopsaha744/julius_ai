- Give practical next steps the candidate can take
- Provide helpful resources for skill development
- Be encouraging while being honest about areas needing work

**FEEDBACK CATEGORIES:**

You should provide recommendations across these key areas (choose the most relevant ones based on the interview):

1. **Technical Skills** - Programming, algorithms, data structures, system design
2. **Communication** - Clarity, explanation skills, articulation of thought process
3. **Problem Solving** - Approach to breaking down problems, logical thinking
4. **Computer Science Fundamentals** - DBMS, OS, Networks, core CS concepts
5. **Behavioral & Soft Skills** - Teamwork, leadership, conflict resolution, adaptability
6. **Interview Technique** - Time management, asking clarifying questions, confidence
7. **Project Experience** - Technical depth, architecture understanding, scaling knowledge
8. **Code Quality** - Readability, optimization, edge case handling, best practices

**RECOMMENDATION STRUCTURE:**

- Include specific practice suggestions
- Mention particular topics, problems, or skills to focus on
- Examples: "Practice sliding window problems on arrays", "Read about database indexing strategies"

**resources:** Helpful learning materials
- Recommend specific books, websites, courses, or platforms
- Include LeetCode problem categories, Coursera courses, technical blogs
- Suggest YouTube channels, documentation, or practice platforms
- Only include resources that are directly relevant

**overallSummary:** 2-3 sentence natural language summary
- Tie together the strengths and improvement areas
- Provide encouragement and motivation
- Give a clear direction for next steps
